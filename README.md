# Detection-of-brain-tumor
A deep learning-based project to classify MRI brain scans as **Tumor** or **No Tumor** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## 🗂️ Dataset

- [Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection)
- Two categories: `yes` (tumor), `no` (no tumor)

## 🧪 Project Goals

- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Build a CNN model for classification
- Evaluate model performance
- Visualize predictions
- (Optional) Deploy as a web app using Streamlit

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Upload MRI images to `data/`
3. Run the notebook in `notebooks/` folder
4. Model will classify if a brain tumor is present
